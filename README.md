## 🔍 Features

📁 **Upload Your Own CSV or Excel File**  

📊 **Comprehensive Time Series Analysis**  
- Summary statistics  
- Interactive line plots  
- Decomposition to detect trend/seasonality  
- ACF and PACF plots  
- Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity  
- Model fitting and forecasting using:
  - ARIMA
  - SARIMA (if seasonality is detected)
  - GARCH (if volatility clustering is detected)
  - Auto ARIMA

🧠 **Smart Model Recommendation Engine**  
- Automatically checks for seasonality and volatility.
- Recommends SARIMA if seasonality is found.
- Suggests GARCH if volatility clustering is detected (via residual ACF + squared ACF).
- Displays messages like _"Seasonality detected – SARIMA recommended"_
- User can still override and select any model manually.

📉 **Residual Diagnostics**  
- Histogram of residuals  
- Shapiro-Wilk test for normality  
- Ljung-Box test  
- ACF plots for residuals and squared residuals  

📥 **Report Download**  
- Generate a downloadable report 
- Summary of selected model, forecast, plots, and diagnostics  
- Automatically reflects recommendations in the report
